# Inventory_Mang_Sys_PY
üè¨ Inventory and Order Management System
This Python project is a basic Inventory and Order Management System designed to simulate real-world warehouse, supplier, and product operations using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It features polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance, making it a great educational tool for understanding core OOP concepts in Python.

üì¶ Features
Product Hierarchy
Abstract base class Product is extended by specialized classes:

Electronic (with warranty)

Furniture (with material type)

Encapsulated Inventory Handling
Stock quantities and supplier details are managed using getter/setter methods.

Supplier Management
Each product is linked to a Supplier instance, which holds details such as name and contact.

Order Placement
Orders can be placed only if sufficient stock is available. A simple validation mechanism updates inventory accordingly.

Warehouse Abstraction
An abstract base class Warehouse is extended by LocalWarehouse and CentralWarehouse, simulating different inventory locations using polymorphism.

Time-stamped Orders
Orders include an auto-generated date using the datetime module.

üõ† Technologies Used
Python 3.x

OOP Concepts: Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism

abc module for abstract base classes

datetime module for order time stamping
